# chord_predictor
Using Jupyter Notebook, I built this project to integrate my passion for the piano with my interest in machine learning. I initialized and trained a model with triads that form melodic chords such as Dm for D minor and A# for A sharp major. The program prompts the user for at least three notes to form a melody and it uses the training data provided to predict a chord that will harmonize with the melody. It then, using pygame, ouputs the sound in the form of a midi file and will play it outloud on the computer speaker. This project helped me create a foundation for my machine learning knowledge.
